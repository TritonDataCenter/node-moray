/*
 * lib/pool.js: Moray connection pool implementation
 *
 * The Moray client leverages the Cueball module for service discovery (via DNS)
 * and for managing TCP connections to a set of backends found via service
 * discovery.  Cueball is responsible for establishing connections (using
 * connection timeouts and backoff as appropriate) and gracefully cleaning up
 * after them when they fail.
 *
 * Cueball also provides a connection pool interface that's oriented around
 * protocols that only support one consumer at a time (like HTTP).  Our use-case
 * is quite different because we can multiplex a large number of requests over
 * the same TCP connection.  As a result, our policy for how many connections to
 * maintain to each instance, the way we allocate and track connections for each
 * request, and the way we react to failures is pretty different than what the
 * connection pool expects.  To accommodate that, we use the simpler
 * ConnectionSet interface, which just maintains a set of connections for us.
 * Here, we implement allocation and connection tracking appropriately.

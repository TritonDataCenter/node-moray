     * It's important to enable TCP KeepAlive on connections to the Moray server
     * so that we can identify connections that have failed as a result of a
     * remote system panic, power cycle, power off, or a network partition.
     * This will not address requests that have hung as a result of a server
     * problem; callers are expected to deal with that on their own.  This
     * client can't necessarily know what timeouts are reasonable, nor the scope
     * of such a problem, nor how to deal with a request that's taking too long.
     *
     * Node provides an API for enabling TCP KeepAlive and setting the initial
     * interval, but it has two major issues: first, on at least Node v0.10 and
     * likely v0.12, it only works once the socket has been connected.  Before
     * that, the request to enable KeepAlive is silently ignored.  For details,
     * see nodejs/node-v0.x-archive issue 8572.  That's why we don't call
     * setKeepAlive() until we get here.
     *
     * Second, the interface only allows us to configure the initial interval of
     * idle time before TCP starts sending KeepAlive probes (equivalent to
     * TCP_KEEPIDLE), not how long to keep sending probes before terminating the
     * connection (TCP_KEEPCNT and TCP_KEEPINTVL or
     * TCP_KEEPALIVE_ABORT_THRESHOLD).  Since Moray is only used inside
     * environments expected to have good network connectivity, an aggressive
     * configuration would be appropriate here, but for now we're left with the
     * system defaults (which are pretty conservative).  We'll eventually learn
     * if this connection fails, but not all that quickly.
